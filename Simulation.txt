What is a simulation?
- A computational model of a system being designed
- operating environment used for various what if scenarios 

Why use simulations
-Time advantage
^guide decisions and test without needing to develope a full end product
-Repeatable
^same parameters and see differences, what factors are we forgetting?
-Visual aid
^Allows to see the problem in an image, brings it to life
-Versatile
^Can apply to any field in any context

Steps for developing a simulation
1. Problem Formulation
2. Setting Objectives
3. Model Conceptualization (Art vs Science)
4. Data Collection
5. Model Translation (Programming)
6. Verification and Validation
7. Experimental designed
8. Runs and Analysis
9. Documentation and Reporting

Applications of simulations
-Waiting/service
-Inventory
-Production and Manufacturing
-Capital Investment and Budgeting
-Logistics
-Services
-Environmental Resource Analysis

What is Prototyping
-Developing a physical model
-Cheaper and less refined
-Better visualize the system
