-serial number ending in N1, N2, N3 is the old style gyro
^requires special command series 
^Has to be told it's the old version

Initial heading (lets go with North)

-These are stepper motors so the number of motor pulses/steps
-convert degrees into the number of steps
^apply the ratio to get the bot to turn however much you need 
^make sure it can correct itself after the initial turn

-initialize brick, gyro, clutch
^two scripts, one to initialize and one method: that way we don't recalibrate everytime 

Lab Requirements 
- Summary of what we did 
- Updated schedule showing what we completed (copy paste with completion notes)


First Success
-Took the initial turn plus 31 adjustments, adjustment ended after reaching an angle change of 0 degrees

Second Try
-Took the initial turn plus 14 adjustments, adjustment ended after reaching an angle change of 0 degrees

Third Try
- Took initial 90 followed by 8 adjustments, adjustment ended after reaching an angle change of 0 degrees

Fourth Try
- Final adjustments were made to our step/degree ratio and we got down to an initial turn plus 1 adjustment
- 87  first followed by 3 Second
